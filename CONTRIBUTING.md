# Contributing to HadesSpace

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the project
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/userXinos/HadesSpace/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/userXinos/HadesSpace/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Translations

In most cases, the project tries to use as much game localization as possible, but some parts of the UI or other characteristics of the game must be created separately.

Thanks to translations provided by the community. Translations for the HadesSpace project should be submitted via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/hadesspace)

- Do not submit translations generated with a translation such as Google Translate, DeepL, or anything of the sorts.
- Only submit translations for languages you are at the very least fluent in, better yet if it's your first language.

## Development Guidelines

Please see the [how to deploy a local development server](/README.md#build-a-developer-build). Also in the module directories there is a README with instructions for use

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Please follow [eslint configuration](/.eslintrc.json)
